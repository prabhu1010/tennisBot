<b>History</b>

This game uses a mathematical model(Lower Bound of Wilson Score Confidence Interval) to "conduct" a 127-game, 128-player Grand Slam tennis tournament point by point.

This was written in C and the Makefile has been adjusted to support both Windows and Unix/Linux. So as with any github repository, feel free to help yourself to the code and play with the tournament algorithm. 

A graphical interface to play this game is in the works...
