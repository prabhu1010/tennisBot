History

Back in 2012, I was watching a tennis Grand Slam tournament on TV. That was when I wondered what would be like to write a computer program that conducts complete 127 match, 7 Round tennis tournaments based on the players actual records. I spent a couple thinking of an appropriate algorithm to simulate the distribution of points during a match, and ran into the Lower Bound of Wilson Score distribution. Refining the idea further, I was able to develop this game.

For more on this game, do look up my web page  <a href="http://www.code-bits.net/fantennis.htm">http://www.code-bits.net/fantennis.htm</a>

This was written in C and compiled on Linux. So as with any github repository, feel free to help yourself to the code and play with the tournament algorithm. 

Happy coding!
